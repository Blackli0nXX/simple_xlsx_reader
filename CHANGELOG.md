### 0.9.2

* Support reading files written by ex. simple_xlsx_writer that don't
  specify sheet dimensions explicitly (which Excel does).

### 0.9.1

* Fixed an important parse bug that ignored empty 'Generic' cells

### 0.9.0

* Initial release. 0.9 version number is meant to reflect the near-stable
  public api, yet still prerelease status of the project.
